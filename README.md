# BackDoorX

I create this BackDoorX just for testing and learn new things.
This script was created a long time ago 2 year ago so make sure that you use python3 
and make sure you provide the same IP address for the Backdoor Server and BackDoor classes.

* Run Backdoor.py file on the computer where you want to install the backdoor
* Run BackdoorServer.py file on your computer
* Wait... and make yourself at home :)
